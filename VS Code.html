       <a href="#">Version 1.92 </a>is now available! Read about the new features and fixes from July.
        <h1>Setting up Visual Studio Code</h1>
        <p>Getting up and running with Visual Studio Code is quick and easy. It is a small download so you can install in a matter of minutes and give VS Code a try.</p>
    <br>
        <a href="#cp" style="text-decoration:none" color="black"><h2>Cross platform</h2></a>
    <p id="cp">VS Code is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.
<br>Follow the platform-specific guides below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">macOS</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Linux</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Windows</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions. You can review the <a href="#">System Requirements</a> to check if your computer configuration is supported.</p>
    <br>
    <a href="#uc" style="text-decoration:none"><h2>Update cadence</h2></a>
    <p id="uc">VS Code releases a new version <a href="#">each month</a> with new features and important bug fixes. Most platforms support auto updating and you will be prompted to install the new release when it becomes available. You can also manually check for updates by running <b> Help > Check for Updates</b> on Linux and Windows or running<b> Code > Check for Updates</b> on macOS.</p>
   <br> Note: You can <a href="#">disable auto-update</a> if you prefer to update VS Code on your own schedule. <br><br>
   <a href="#inb" style="text-decoration:none"><h2>Insider Nighty Build</h2></a>
   <p id="inb">If you'd like to try our nightly builds to see new features early or verify bug fixes, you can install our Insiders build. The Insiders build installs side-by-side with the monthly Stable build and you can freely work with either on the same machine. The <a href="#">Insiders build</a> is the same one the VS Code development team uses on a daily basis and we really appreciate people trying out new features and providing feedback.</p>   
<br><br>
<a href="#pm" style="text-decoration:none"><h2>Portable Mode</h2></a>
<p id="pm">Visual Studio Code supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application">portable mode</a> installation. This mode enables all data created and maintained by VS Code to live near itself, so it can be moved around across environments, for example, on a USB drive. See the <a href="#">VS Code Portable Mode</a> documentation for details.</p>
<br><br>
<a href="#e" style="text-decoration:none"><h2>Extensions</h2></a>
<p id="e">VS Code <a href="#">extensions</a> let third parties add support for additional:
<ul>
    <li>Languages - C++, C#, Go, Java, Python</li>
    <li>Tools - ESLint, JSHint , PowerShell</li>
    <li>Debuggers - PHP XDebug.</li>
    <li>Keymaps - Vim, Sublime Text, IntelliJ, Emacs, Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio, Eclipse</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions integrate into VS Code's UI, commands, and task running systems so you'll find it easy to work with different technologies through VS Code's shared interface. Check out the VS Code extension Marketplace to see what's available.</p>
